1] Why must we choose you?

I was passionate to make my carrer in coding field beacuse i used to love it since my schooling. Coding for me is like passion ,that i contribute alot to it. I love to make coding as my carrier. I hardly believe that AMFOSS will lead me to the path  that i passionate . I believe that AMFOSS will undestand my passion towards coding and will choose me for the club.Im sure that i will defenitly do my work on time and well good

2] What is your plan for the next 6 months?

Go through the tasks and learn all the applications that are required to be and work on my dream to be a software developer .I want to continue in this field as much long i was and im sure that if i got selected to the AMFOSS i can definetly make the best result in AMFOSS as well as in my academics .

3] How would you contribute back to the club ?

I will try my atmost limit to give the club wants from me .i would help my juniors that how my seniors helped me do the tasks.

4] Do you have any feedback for the selection process ?

I doesnt know how's this process been going but i want it be fair so that people who dreamt for it and worked hard for it, 
can be a part of Amfoss.
