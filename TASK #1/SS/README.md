I was new to computer course ,seeing the task i feel that this wont be happen with me but this was quite easy and i was pretty happy to see when its done.
Open star users
Then i login with GitHub user id.
I Opened star.user.js;then gone to developer tools [⌘+⌥+I ] .I used this as I was an Mac user .then go to console and paste the code and hit return. it returned as "its done".
