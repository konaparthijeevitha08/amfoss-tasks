My personal website link.
I really liked it alot having my own website .
In a very easy steps, this wont that difficult to do.
Youtube and Google helped me alot while doing this task.
Firstly fork the github personal website repository .
Use jekyll and customize the jekyll settings ;then go to the posts file and add things about the task then update it.
Then go to Prose by Development Seed.
Then go to config.yml file. It is optimised using Jekyll and add the details like personal website name, GitHub user name and location of GitHub avatar/profile pic.
Edit  /_posts/2014-3-3-Hello-World.md to publish first blog post.
Update the /_posts/2014-3-3-Hello-World.md .
Now add a new file (first-blog-post) and write about how’s the tasks gone and publish it .and update it.
First blog in personal website is ready.
